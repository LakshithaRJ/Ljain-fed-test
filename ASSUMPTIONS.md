## Description of my solution

This Angular app consists of 3 components of which app-component houses the header and user-details in addition to a service used to fetch data from 
https://randomuser.me/api/. Initially only the Fetch User Details button is displayed upon clicking which I fetch single user details. Once this is done
another button Called Fetch more results button is displayed which fetches details for 5 more users.

## Things I would do next

I would really like to extend this solution where I append the newly fetched users below the existing cards.

## Assumptions that I made

I assumed that the app is supposed to be developed in Angular where the repo link to be forked consisted React code, upon clarifying with Gitanjalee I 
proceeded to develop the app in Angular.
